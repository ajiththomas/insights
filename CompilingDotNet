To Compile a Standalone .cs File
If you want to compile a single C# file without creating a project, use the csc compiler directly:

Install .NET SDK (if not already installed)

Ensure the .NET SDK is installed, as it includes the csc (C# compiler) tool.

Compile with csc

csc -out:RunasCs.exe RunasCs.cs
Or Use Mono (Optional Alternative)

If you're using Mono instead of the .NET SDK:
mcs -out:RunasCs.exe RunasCs.cs

If You Need a .csproj File for dotnet build

Create a new console application project:
dotnet new console -n RunasCsProject

Replace the auto-generated Program.cs file with the RunasCs.cs file:
mv RunasCs.cs RunasCsProject/RunasCs.cs

Navigate to the project directory:
cd RunasCsProject

Build the project:
dotnet build -o output

The resulting executable (RunasCs.exe) will be in the output folder.

Summary
Use csc for standalone .cs file compilation.
Use dotnet build for project-based compilation, which requires a .csproj file.
